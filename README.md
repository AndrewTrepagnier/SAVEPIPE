# SAVEPIPE 
The Industry-proven tool for determining retirement limits of process piping.


## Introduction

Many oil and gas companies are faced with maintaining 10,000+ miles of 100+ year old piping networks supporting multi-billion dollar/year processing operations. There is rarely a simple solution to immediately shutdown a process pipe - as these shutdowns more often than not impact other units and cost companies millions in time and resources. 

In mechanical integrity engineering, we are frequently asked the hard question - **do we have to shutdown the pipe immediately, or do we have time?** Pipe retirement requires rigorous analysis. You must find the perfect balance - such that one isn't squandering company time/resources but also holding personnel safety paramount. 

**This is more than a python package, it is a comprehensive engineering decision support system for critical infrastructure safety and operational continuity.**

## The Challenge

**Cross-section of Pipe Wall Thinning Over Time**

Every day, mechanical integrity engineers face decisions that can cost millions of dollars or risk catastrophic failure. When a pipe shows signs of thinning, the clock starts ticking. You need answers fast:

- **Can this pipe continue operating safely?**
- **How much time do we have before retirement is mandatory?**
- **What are the consequences of immediate shutdown vs. continued operation?**
- **How do we balance operational continuity with personnel safety?**

These aren't theoretical questions - they're real decisions that affect production, safety, and the bottom line. SAVEPIPE was built by engineers, for engineers, to provide the analytical rigor needed for these critical decisions.

## Understanding Pipe Retirement Limits

Imagine a pipe wall gradually thinning over a 10-year span, slowly approaching a critical red line - the **retirement limit**. This is the minimum acceptable wall thickness that ensures safe operation. When the actual thickness hits this line, the pipe must be retired or replaced immediately.

### The Two Minimum Thickness Requirements

Pipe design involves two distinct minimum thickness calculations. The **pressure design minimum** ensures the pipe can contain internal pressure safely using ASME B31.1 equations that consider design pressure, temperature effects, and material properties. The **structural minimum** ensures the pipe can support its own weight and external loads according to API 574 Table D.2 requirements, which becomes critical for per-code pipe spans. However, this package does not account for fluid weight, insulation, heat tracing equipment, pipe hangers, and other per-application basis.

The **limiting thickness** is whichever of these two values is more restrictive. SAVEPIPE automatically determines which factor controls your design and provides clear guidance on current status, remaining life, and required actions.

### Corrosion Allowance and Remaining Life

The difference between your actual thickness and the retirement limit is your **corrosion allowance** - essentially your safety margin. This allowance, combined with your known corrosion rate from inspection reports, determines how much time you have before retirement becomes mandatory. 

This analytical approach transforms the complex retirement decision into a clear, data-driven process that balances operational needs with safety requirements.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AndrewTrepagnier/SAVEPIPE.git
cd SAVEPIPE

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

```python
from savepipe.core import SAVEPIPE

# Create a pipe instance
pipe = SAVEPIPE(
    schedule="40",
    nps="2", 
    pressure=500.0,
    pressure_class=600,
    metallurgy="CS A106 GR B",
    corrosion_rate=10.0  # mpy (optional)
)

# Perform comprehensive analysis
results = pipe.analyze_pipe_thickness(actual_thickness=0.060)

# Generate full report with visualizations
report_files = pipe.generate_full_report(actual_thickness=0.060)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Analysis
```python
# Simple thickness check
pipe = SAVEPIPE("40", "2", 500.0, 600, "CS A106 GR B")
results = pipe.analyze_pipe_thickness(actual_thickness=0.060)

print(f"Limiting Factor: {results['limiting_type']}")
print(f"Status: {'ADEQUATE' if results['limiting_thickness'] <= 0.060 else 'INADEQUATE'}")
```

### With Corrosion Analysis
```python
# Include corrosion rate for life prediction
pipe = SAVEPIPE(
    schedule="40", nps="2", pressure=500.0, 
    pressure_class=600, metallurgy="CS A106 GR B",
    corrosion_rate=15.0  # 15 mpy corrosion rate
)

results = pipe.analyze_pipe_thickness(actual_thickness=0.080)
print(f"Remaining Life: {results.get('life_span', 'N/A')} years")
```

# Generate comprehensive report with visualizations
report_files = pipe.generate_full_report(actual_thickness=0.060)

# Files automatically saved to Reports/ folder with timestamps
